# Create a local swarm, the Char virtual machine should be its manager

# Create two worker machines
docker-machine create -d virtualbox worker1
docker-machine create -d virtualbox worker2

# connect to the machines in your swarm via ssh
docker-machine ip Char
docker-machine ssh Char

# once inside the machine, use this command to designate a manager
docker swarm init --advertise-addr # 192.168.99.117 # you must use the ip address of the machine that you want to be the manager

# inside the manager machine, run this command to get a token to add to the swarm
# docker swarm join-token worker
# copy the token and ssh into the newly created worker machine(s) you've designated to join the swarm
# EG: docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1tgio2fmvtotcb602dlezufgrzr5mjbc1bzt4u4sw4tlz6qy90-bdhn9r1cg6hl2weuhp33buqqz 192.168.99.117:2377

# Use this command inside your manager machine to verify your swarm where leader is the manager
docker node ls
