# Docker-1

The goal for this group project is to familiarize yourself with Docker containers, Dockerfiles and Docker swarm:

I'm enjoyed working on this project because I was able to explore concepts that interested me during my research. The majority of my time was spent googling although
I also managed to practice working with bash scripts in the process, which I very much enjoyed.

**Project Document:**
[Docker-1.pdf](assets/docker.en.pdf)

All functions were written according to 42's coding standard,
[the Norm](https://github.com/micriver/docker-project/assets/docker.en%20.pdf).

Download the repository by copying and pasting the commands below.

You can compile the ```./fillit``` executable using the Makefile:
